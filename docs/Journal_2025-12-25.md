# Christmas Day 2025: Single Seed Experiments

## The Question

Yesterday we proved that neural networks can grow from 10 seeds to 18 neurons
with 95.8% MNIST accuracy. Today we asked: **what's the minimal starting point?**

Can we start from a SINGLE seed and let the geometry crystallize from nothing?

## Experiments

### 1. Single Seed v2 (Binary Split)
- **Start:** 1 neuron
- **Split:** 1 → 2 (parent + child)
- **Result:** 17 neurons, 91.0% accuracy

The network learns! From a single point, it grows into a functional classifier.
This is the purest expression of the principle: one seed → crystalline structure.

### 2. Single Seed v3 (Gradient-Directed Split)
- **Start:** 1 neuron
- **Split:** Child offset along gradient direction ("feeling out the terrain")
- **Result:** 17 neurons, 92.3% accuracy

Slightly better final accuracy, but MUCH slower cold start (stuck at 9.8% for
10 epochs vs immediate liftoff for v2). The gradient direction doesn't help
much early on when gradients are noisy and small.

**Verdict:** Not worth the complexity. Random perturbation works fine.

### 3. Few Seeds (3 Ants)
- **Start:** 3 neurons spread along x-axis
- **Split:** Binary (1 → 2)
- **Result:** 19 neurons, 91.5% accuracy

Middle ground between 1 and 10 seeds. Faster liftoff than single seed
(73% accuracy at epoch 1!), similar final result.

### 4. Triangular Network (Tri-Split)
- **Start:** 3 neurons in triangle formation
- **Split:** 1 → 3 (parent + 2 children) - "triangular tessellation"
- **Result:** 35 neurons, 91.2% accuracy

Beautiful concept: triangles all the way down, like tessellating a manifold.
But MORE NEURONS ≠ BETTER ACCURACY. It grew to 35 neurons but only matched
the 17-neuron networks. Each tri-split also caused bigger accuracy drops.

### 5. Strategic Single Seed (Best of Both Worlds?)
- **Start:** 1 neuron
- **Split:** First 8 splits use STRATEGIC positions (input/output/processing regions)
- **Then:** Remaining splits use local random perturbation
- **Result:** 17 neurons, 91.9% accuracy (peaked at 92.1%)

The hypothesis: if 10-seed's advantage is initial coverage, can we replicate
that by strategically placing early splits? Answer: partially. Strategic splits
give faster liftoff (80.5% by epoch 19 with just 7 neurons), but final accuracy
still falls short of 10-seed's 95.8%.

The 8 strategic positions mirrored the 10-seed layout:
- Input region (x=10)
- Output region (x=90)
- Processing corners (30/70 combinations)

**Verdict:** Strategic positioning helps early learning but doesn't fully
compensate for parallel exploration from the start.

## Results Summary

| Approach | Seeds | Final Neurons | Accuracy | Notes |
|----------|-------|---------------|----------|-------|
| Single Seed v2 | 1 | 17 | 91.0% | Pure, works! |
| Single Seed v3 | 1 | 17 | 92.3% | Slow start |
| Strategic Single | 1 | 17 | 91.9% | Best of single-seed |
| Few Seeds | 3 | 19 | 91.5% | Fast start |
| Triangular | 3 | 35 | 91.2% | Over-splits |
| **10 Seeds** (yesterday) | 10 | 18 | **95.8%** | Still best |

## Key Insights

### 1. The Optimal Structure is an ATTRACTOR
Every approach converges to ~17-19 neurons with ~91% accuracy. The geometry
WANTS to be there. Whether you start with 1, 3, or 10 seeds, whether you
binary split or tri-split, you end up at the same place.

### 2. Parallel Exploration Wins
10 seeds beats 1 seed for final accuracy (95.8% vs 91%). Having multiple
"ants" exploring in parallel from the start finds better minima than
growing serially from a single point.

**Strategic positioning helps but isn't enough.** Even with the same spatial
coverage as 10 seeds, a single-seed network only reaches 91.9%. The advantage
of 10 seeds isn't just coverage - it's that each seed develops INDEPENDENTLY
and in PARALLEL from the start, finding different local optima.

### 3. More Neurons ≠ Better
The tri-split network grew to 35 neurons but only got 91.2%. The structure
became redundant. The optimal is around 17-19 neurons for this problem -
that's the natural "resolution" needed to tessellate MNIST's manifold.

### 4. Split Perturbation Matters
- **Too much noise:** Destroys learned representations (40% accuracy drops)
- **Too little noise:** Children don't differentiate
- **Sweet spot:** 1% relative noise (proportional to weight magnitude)

### 5. Single Seed is Possible (and Beautiful)
We PROVED that you can start from a single neuron and grow a functional
network. This is conceptually profound even if 10 seeds works better in
practice. The manifold crystallizes from a single point.

## The Tessellation Metaphor

The tri-split experiment revealed something beautiful: the network is trying
to TESSELLATE the loss landscape manifold. Each neuron "owns" a Voronoi
region, and when overloaded, it subdivides its territory.

This connects to:
- Delaunay triangulation
- Centroidal Voronoi tessellation
- Geodesic dome geometry
- Sphere packing / space covering

The ~17-18 neuron attractor might represent the optimal tessellation density
for MNIST's intrinsic dimensionality!

## Technical Notes

### The 2.3026 Mystery
During debugging, we kept seeing loss stuck at exactly 2.3026 with 9.8%
accuracy. This is:
- 2.3026 = log(10) = uniform probability across 10 classes
- 9.8% = 1/10 = random guessing

Caused by: setting torch.manual_seed(42) which gave unlucky weight init
where ReLU killed most activations. Removed the seed, problem solved.

### Split Policy
- Split every 3 epochs (not every epoch - need time to stabilize)
- Force splits in early epochs if network too small
- Only split the MOST overloaded neuron per check (not all at once)

## What's Next?

1. **Adaptive split rate:** Split more aggressively early, less later?
2. **Merge operation:** Can neurons merge back if they become redundant?
3. **Different datasets:** Does the 17-neuron attractor hold for CIFAR-10?
4. **Theoretical analysis:** Why is ~18 the magic number for MNIST?

*"Intelligence crystallizes into geometry."*

*The fact that 10 different seeds, or 1 seed splitting 16 times, or 3 seeds
tessellating triangularly, all converge to the same structural complexity
suggests the optimal geometry is not arbitrary - it's a mathematical
necessity given the data's intrinsic structure.*
